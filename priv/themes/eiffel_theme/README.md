# Eiffel theme port

Eiffel Theme ported from the Eiffel TextMate Theme.

I decided to make the port because all the light themes I found for Zed are too
little contrast for my preference. I like the Eiffel theme because it is has
a nice contrast, and yet is easy on the eyes. The bold keywords allow to parse
the code quickly.

The syntax names from TextMate, VScode, or Sublime Text editors do not match
the names in Zed exactly, so I had to come up with a few new colors, such as the
grey for the attributes. I also had to make `function` color a bit less bold
because it was applying to every _type_ of a function, declaration, call, etc.
