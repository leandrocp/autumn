# ![Base16](screenshots/logo.png)

A port of the base16 color schemes designed by Chris Kempson for the Zed editor.
The themes are generated based on schemes sourced from the [tinted-theming organization](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home).

## Custom themes

To create a custom theme, first run the `generate_themes.sh` script to populate the `themes` directory. Then manually tweak the theme file. When finished add `_custom` to the theme name (for example `base16-ocean_custom.json`). When regenerating new themes with the `generate_themes.sh` script, the custom themes will not be overwritten and the default variant will be removed to avoid duplicates.
