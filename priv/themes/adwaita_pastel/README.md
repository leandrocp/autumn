# Adwaita Pastel theme for Zed

Adwaita (GNOME) theme for Zed with bold syntax highlighting borrowed from Catppuccin

- UI colors from libadwaita apps (with some tweaks)
- Terminal colors from GNOME Console
- Syntax highlighting from [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/zed) Mocha and Latte themes
- Inspiration from [Adwaita theme for VS Code](https://github.com/piousdeer/vscode-adwaita)

## Installation

Hopefully this theme gets added to the official Zed themes, in which case you should be able to just install it as an extension.

Until then, download the repo and use the `zed: install dev extension` command to install it in Zed.
