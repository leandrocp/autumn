# Sublime Mariana Theme for Zed Editor

Theme for the [Zed Editor](https://zed.dev/) that imitates Sublime Text 4's Mariana theme.

The Mariana color scheme is known for its cool, muted tones that provide a soothing yet vibrant coding environment, making it easy on the eyes during long coding sessions. This theme avoids the use of cursive or italic styles, ensuring a consistent and clean look across all text elements for enhanced readability and focus.

## Installation

First, install Sublime Mariana via extenstion's manager:

1. `Go` → `Command Palette...` → **zed:extensions** (or use hotkeys `⌘⇧X`)
2. Select `Sublime Mariana Theme` and press `Install`.

Then, enable it:

1. `Go` → `Command Palette...` → **theme selector:toggle** (or use hotkeys `⌘K ⌘T`)
2. Pick `Sublime Mariana` or `Sublime Breakers`

## Variations

This theme brings the beloved aesthetic of Sublime Text 4's Mariana theme to the Zed editor, with two distinct variations: Mariana and Mariana Breakers. The Mariana variation closely mirrors the original, offering a cool, muted color scheme that’s easy on the eyes. Meanwhile, Mariana Breakers introduces subtle enhancements for a refreshing twist, maintaining the same calming vibe with added contrast for improved readability.
