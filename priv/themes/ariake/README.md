# zed-ariake-theme

Ariake is inspired by Japanese traditional colors and ancient poetry. The name "Ariake" (有明) refers to dawn or daybreak in Japanese, evoking a sense of subtle beauty and transition.

This theme draws inspiration from the following poem by Mibu no Tadamine (壬生忠岑), a renowned poet from the Heian period (794-1185):

> "有明の　つれなく見えし　別れより　暁ばかり　憂きものはなし"
>
> "Since I saw the moon in dawn when you said good-bye, My heart aches every time I see it again."
